# JuliaOpenCVBindingTest
This branch has some progress on automated generation. Please look at gen3.py which can generate bits of relevant C++ code

### TODO
 - Ensure correct argument conversion (Vectors, Mats, ...) - partially done
 - Julia side code
 - Tests


### DONE
 - Constants and enums
 - Most functions
 - Most classes and classmethods
 - Getters and Setters
 - Data retrieval form hdr_parser
 - Support Algorithm inherited classes
 - Generate final namespace C++ code
 - Handle types.hpp


To run, first modify hdr_parser.py with appropriate header file names. Then use

```python3 gen3_{lang}.py```

The script will crash but it will print relevant output regarding generated function code before exiting. ```autocode.cpp``` and ```autocode.jl``` are two WIP autogenerated files.

```autocode.cpp``` now compiles too and has all of the cv namespace imports based on the test header list integrated.
